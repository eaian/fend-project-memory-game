## Project_Title

This is a project for a Memory Game that utilizes JQuery, Javascript and DOM.

## Instructions

This game will start as the player click the restart button on upper right portion of the board game. 
There are 16 cards to match (a total of 8 pairs). 
Once completed a score card would appear showing your scores based on star count, time duration and number of moves (selection of 2 cards for a pair is counted as 1 move). 
To close the window for score card hit "Close" or "Play Again" to refresh the page so you could start again ("Don't forget to hit Restart Button).
